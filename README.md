# Netsuke - Fitzwilliam

This small exhibition brought together 250 superb examples of netsuke - a form of miniature sculpture originating in 17th-century Japan. These often elaborately carved items were designed to function as ‘toggles’ for the silk cords upon which Japanese men strung their pipes, purses or writing implements. These webpage take you through the collection of the Fitzwilliam.

Traditional Japanese clothing does not include pockets. Instead, items are suspended from a belt by means of a cord. A toggle (netsuke) at the end of the cord prevents it from slipping through. The types of sagemono (suspended objects) used in this way include medicine containers, pipe holders and tobacco pouches. In the 18th century and early 19th century, netsuke and sagemono were important components of Japanese costume, and were symbols of social status. A well-dressed gentleman in Japan seldom appeared on the street without a carefully considered ensemble of netsuke and sagemono suspended from the sash of his garment.
