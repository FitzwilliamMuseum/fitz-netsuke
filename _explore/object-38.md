Figure of a dutchman

Under the policy called _sakoku_, in force in Japan from the 1630s until 1853, foreigners were excluded from the country.

The only exceptions were the Dutch who had a trading post near Nagasaki. They were regarded as curiosities due to their physical appearance, their clothing and their habit of keeping animals.
