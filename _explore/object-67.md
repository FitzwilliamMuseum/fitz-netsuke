Ono no Tofu wearing ceremonial garments and holding a fan and an umbrella
The frog by his foot is part of the story of Ono no Tofu, a calligrapher at the imperial court in the 10th century. When despondent about failing to be promoted he watched a frog repeatedly trying, but failing, to leap up a willow branch. Finally the frog succeeded and Ono no Tofu was encouraged to persist
